# IXIHold'em Mini App

Simple 2-player Texas Hold'em poker mini app for the Ixian blockchain using Spixi Mini Apps SDK.

---

## Game Logic

- Two players join by sending 100 IXI entry fee each to the app wallet.
- When 2 players joined, the game starts automatically.
- Each player gets 2 random cards.
- Community cards are dealt in rounds: Flop (3 cards), Turn (1 card), River (1 card).
- Winner is randomly chosen for simplicity (can be improved later).
- Winner claims the prize (180 IXI) by sending a chat message to the app wallet.

## Blockchain & Spixi SDK Integration

- Entry fee deposits are monitored via `spixi.hooks.onDeposit`.
- Deposits are verified on-chain for correctness (amount and address).
- Prize is not automatically sent; winner must claim it via chat message.
- The app address is the same for receiving deposits and sending prizes.

## Setup and Testing

- Replace `APP_ADDRESS` in `index.js` with your real Ixian wallet address.
- Deploy the mini app using Spixi Mini Apps SDK environment.
- Test sending IXI from two different wallets.
- Once both deposits confirmed, game starts.
- Winner is randomly selected and can claim prize.

## Notes

- This is a simplified implementation focused on mainnet real IXI deposits.
- The poker logic can be enhanced for real hand evaluations.
- Prize payout must be done manually by the operator after claim message.
